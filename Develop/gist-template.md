Introductory paragraph (In this Gist I will be explaining the process of Regex. Will be doing a tutorial)

## Summary

Regex are regular expressions that are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern. For example, one of them would be an email one such as (/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/)
